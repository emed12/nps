This web map shows the 2023 yearly traffic of visitors to 63 National Parks in the U.S., represented through proportional symbols. The data for this application was created by me, using: the National Park Service’s 2023 Bucket List of all 63 national parks; searching Google for latitude and longitude coordinates of each park on this list; and finding visitor use statistics on the National Park Service website (links included at the bottom of this document). The map symbols show the location of each park, and their size represents the amount of visitors to that park in 2023 — larger symbols means there were more visitors that year. Also included are a scale bar, legend, and mouse over feature that highlights specific parks and opens related information.
